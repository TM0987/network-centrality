# network-centrality
This was a project for HNUH258V (Collective Behavior in Natural and Artificial Systems) at the University of Maryland.

Based off the paper "A centrality measure for quantifying spread on weighted, directed networks," I implemented various centrality measurement algorithms in Python along to compare to the Viral Centrality algorithm proposed by the authors. I also implemented a Python version of the Independent Cascade Model to generate ground-truth values for the comparison of the various algorithms.
